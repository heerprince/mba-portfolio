I‚Äôve captured my learning process and maintained authenticity in my use of AI."

    "text": "What Worked Well\nAs someone new to VS Code and Quarto, using an LLM helped me overcome technical challenges. I used ChatGPT to: - Generate clear, structured .qmd files for each website page. - Design my _quarto.yml configuration for navigation. - Generate a dynamic home page, and organize the content on site pages like About, Resume, and Projects. - Advise me on how to best showcase my skills, completed projects, and work history.\nI was able to understand both the ‚Äúhow‚Äù and the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of the entirety of the Quarto system by being able to ask specific instructions in real time. This gave meaning to the learning process and it accelerated it."

    "text": "Ensuring Authenticity\nWhile LLMs were instrumental in drafting, I made sure to personalize all AI-generated content. I revised text to reflect my real experience, achievements, and voice. For instance: - I modified the project descriptions to accurately match what I had worked on. - I tailored skills to align with tools and areas I am confident in, such as Excel, Power BI, and financial forecasting. - I included a link to download my resume and my individual contact information.\nBy combining AI-assisted drafts with personal edits and factual checks, I ensured that my website is a true representation of who I am."

With the help of the LLM, I was able to fix some minor syntax issues and troubleshoot my issues with page previews.\nI also learned how valuable visuals can be. By adding my headshot and linking my resume as two visual elements I created better professionalism."

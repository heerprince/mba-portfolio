# ðŸ¤– Reflection: Leveraging LLMs in Portfolio Development

I primarily relied on the engagement of Large Language Models (LLMs), in particular ChatGPT, to guide, structure, and improve my work as I built my MBA portfolio into a full-fledged multi-page Quarto website. I've captured my learning process and maintained authenticity in my use of AI.

## What Worked Well

As someone new to VS Code and Quarto, using an LLM helped me overcome technical challenges. I used ChatGPT to:
- Generate clear, structured `.qmd` files for each website page.
- Design my `_quarto.yml` configuration for navigation.
- Generate a dynamic home page, and organize the content on site pages like About, Resume, and Projects.
- Advise me on how to best showcase my skills, completed projects, and work history.

I was able to understand both the "how" and the "why" of the entirety of the Quarto system by being able to ask specific instructions in real time. This gave meaning to the learning process and it accelerated it.

## Ensuring Authenticity

While LLMs were instrumental in drafting, I made sure to personalize all AI-generated content. I revised text to reflect my real experience, achievements, and voice. For instance:
- I modified the project descriptions to accurately match what I had worked on.
- I tailored skills to align with tools and areas I am confident in, such as Excel, Power BI, and financial forecasting.
- I included a link to download my resume and my individual contact information.

By combining AI-assisted drafts with personal edits and factual checks, I ensured that my website is a true representation of who I am.

## Difficulties and Improvements

The most difficult task was configuring the navigation and ensuring the pages were displayed properly. With the help of the LLM, I was able to fix some minor syntax issues and troubleshoot my issues with page previews.

I also learned how valuable visuals can be. By adding my headshot and linking my resume as two visual elements I created better professionalism.

## Final Thoughts

This assignment allowed me to learn again how to build a website using Quarto, but even more importantly, how to responsibly utilize AI in my academic and professional plans.  LLMs allowed me to think quicker, organize better, and write with more confidence to be sure the final voice is mine.
